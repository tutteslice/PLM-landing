# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The news generation feature currently has several issues that prevent it from working reliably. Users report problems with article generation failing, missing environment variables, error handling, and inconsistent output quality. This feature needs to be fixed to provide reliable AI-powered Swedish news article generation with proper source integration and error handling.

1. WHEN generation starts THEN the system SHALL log the topic and timestamp
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log response status and timing
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN generation completes THEN the system SHALL log success metrics including source count and content length

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to validate inputs and handle edge cases properly, so that the interface is robust and user-friendly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit an empty topic THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
2. WHEN I submit a topic with special characters THEN the system SHALL handle it safely
3. WHEN the topic is too long THEN the system SHALL truncate or return a validation error
